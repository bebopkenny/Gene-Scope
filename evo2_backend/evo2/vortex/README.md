# Vortex

</div>


This repository contains implementations of computational primitives for convolutional multi-hybrid models and layers: Hyena-[SE, MR, LI], StripedHyena 2, Evo 2.

For training, please refer to the [savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna/) project.

## Interface

There are two main ways to interface with `vortex`:

1. Use `vortex` as the inference engine for pre-trained multi-hybrids such as [Evo 2 40B](configs/evo2-40b-1m.yml). In this case, we recommend installing `vortex` in a new environment (see below).
2. Import from `vortex` specific classes, kernels or utilities to work with custom convolutional multi-hybrids. For example,sourcing utilities from `hyena_ops.interface`.


## 1. Quick install for vortex ops

```bash
make setup-vortex-ops
```
Note that this does not install all dependencies required to run autoregressive inference with larger pre-trained models.

## 2. Building a custom inference environment

### Using conda, venv or uv

To run e2e installation in a uv environment, use the following command:
```bash
make setup-full
```
Note that the `setup-full` step will compile various CUDA kernels, which usually takes at most several minutes. It may be necessary to customize CUDA header and library paths in `Makefile`.  

### Generation quickstart

```bash
python3 generate.py \
    --config_path <PATH_TO_CONFIG> \
    --checkpoint_path <PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT> \
    --input_file <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE> \
    --cached_generation
```
`--cached_generation` activates KV-caching and custom caching for different variants of Hyena layers, reducing peak memory usage and latency.
